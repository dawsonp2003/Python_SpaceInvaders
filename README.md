# Python_SpaceInvaders
Program I created in my free time to become more experienced with Python.

Specifically:
- Multi-wave attacks of aliens moving down every time any alien ship interacts with the left or right side of the screen.
- Every 5th wave, include a boss to defeat
- Either have a final wave or find a way to make it go on infinitely until death
- Either shoot faster over time or allow player to choose upgrades.
